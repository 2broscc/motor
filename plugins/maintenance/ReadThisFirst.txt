Hi!

This is a maintenance plugin designed to inform users of a site being down due to upgrading or just to make them mad... mostly the first option...

In your users.auth.tpl place {MAINTENANCE} tag.

There are two options to choose from...

The first is having the user redirect to users.php?m=auth
The second is having a user redirect to a file within the seditio root.


First things first:

Upload the script into plugins/maintenance

Install script in Administration

Choose The Options You Desire

------

Breaking Down The Options....

To Acheive Option 1

Click Maintenance Mode Turned On : Yes
Click Redirect to the user auth page. This is the default choice... : Yes

This gets the user redirecting to users.php?m=auth

To Acheive Option 2
Maintenance Mode Turned On : "Yes"

Change script to redirect to a different page? : "Yes"

Place your page into the following form feild... this can only be a file located in the SED root... no off site pages...

----------

If you use options 2 remember you can always go to users.php?m=auth and log in again.


Have Fun!
